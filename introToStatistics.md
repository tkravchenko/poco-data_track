# Average
1. A **mean** is the sum of all observations in your population or sample divided by the number of observations in that population or sample.
*Example:*
- This is a sample of 10 Japanese ages. Summing the ages, you get 473. Therefore the mean average is 473 divided by 10 or 47.3. Mean reduces information from these 10 observations to one value. Let's compare Japan's average age, 47.3 to Uganda's average age.

2. The **median** is the middle number of a data set. When sorted from smallest to largest half the numbers are less than the median & half the numbers are above the median. 
- The median is more robust to outliers, unlike the mean. So if your dataset has a lot of outliers, the mean will be pulled in the direction of the outliers.
- Recall that for an odd number of observations, a median is the middle value in the data. With an even number of observations, the median is the mean of the two middle values. 
- To manually calculate a median, the data needs to be sorted (unlike if you are using the MEDIAN() function).

3. The **mode** is a number that appears most often in a dataset. This Japanese age sample has 48 listed twice. Thus, the mode average is 48.
- If every value is unique, then there is no mode, and if there is a tie, then the sample can have 2+ modes.
